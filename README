BeagleBoneGreen SWD
===================

BeagleBoneGreen SWD (BBG-SWD) is a tool to control SWD protocol by
BeagleBoneGreen or PocketBeagle.


Note for release 0.04
=====================

The patches are against OpenOCD 0.10.0.
```shell=
bbb_swd_silabs.patch
```

The BBG-SWD driver is ready for use.  It is tested with MGM210P MCU

Use of "bone-kernel" is assumed for UIO user space PRUSS driver.

The delay constant in pru-swd.p is changed for speed.  And I modified
original OpenOCD Cortex-M target, so that it works for my boards.




The methodology
===============

It takes advantage of using PRUSS (Programmable Realtime Unit
SubSytem) on the processor, so that the SWD communication could be
reliable, accurate and fast.

It assumes use of PRUSSDRV user space library with UIO user space
PRUSS driver.

I use "bone-kernel" for that.


Software License
================

The program pru-swd.p is distributed under GPLv3+.

The OpenOCD patch  is under GPLv2+.


Patches for OpenOCD
===================

The patch is: `bbb_swd_silabs.patch`

This was for OpenOCD, and it was against the commit: ::

        406f4d1c68330e3bf8d9db4e402fd8802a5c79e2

The root file system I use was based on Debian Jessie.  /ID.txt said: ::

        BeagleBoard.org Debian Image 2016-01-24

This patch will add support for SWD utlizing PRU module, as well as add support for
MGM210P MCU family (ARM Cortex M33) of Silicon Labs

The kernel in use was `4.4.145-bone-rt-r23`.

For BBG-SWD, "ti-rt" kernel does not work well because PRUSS support
is different in this kernel.


Installation
===================
Clone this repository in Beaglebone, together with all submodules
```shell=
git clone https://github.com/enviosystems/bbb-swd
cd bbb-swd
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
To install PRU driver simply run
```shell=
make -f am335x_pru_package/Makefile install
```

To apply the patch, you need to first, validate the patch
```shell=
	cd <openocd_source_directory>
	git apply --stat <path_to_patch>/<patch>
```
A dry run is recommended before applying patch to the project
```shell=
	git apply --check <path_to_patch>/<patch>
```
If no error is shown above, then you can safely apply the patch
```shell=
	patch -p1 < <path_to_patch>/<patch>
```


Then, you can configure BBG-SWD driver by the `--enable-bbg-swd` option and build OpenOCD
```shell=
    ./configure --enable-bbg-swd
    sudo make install
 ```   

To build mgm-pru-swd.p run
```shell=
am335x_pru_package/pru_sw/utils/pasm -b -V3 mgm-pru-swd.p
```
I put the program for PRUSS in:
```shell=
sudo mv mgm-pru-swd.bin /usr/local/share/openocd/bbg-swd/pru-swd.bin
```


MGM21 flashing examples
==============================

There are several binaries available for MGM21 flashing in Binaries folder. To flash `ncp-uart-sw.hex` file simply run
```shell=
openocd -f  flash-ncp-uart-sw.cfg
```   
IMPORTANT: You need to reset th MCU manually after flashing, as at the moment this is not handling the RESET pin

This is a binary for Zigbee NCP UART. To test it on UART1 run (assuming that Zigbee GW App is already installed)
```shell=
siliconlabsgateway -n 0 -p /dev/ttyS1
```
Tho output should be something like this:
```shell=
