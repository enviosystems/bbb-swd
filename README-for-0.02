The patch is: 0001-Add-new-SWD-driver-bbg-swd.patch

This was for OpenOCD, and it was against the commit: ::

        406f4d1c68330e3bf8d9db4e402fd8802a5c79e2

The root file system I use was based on Debian Jessie.  /ID.txt said: ::

        BeagleBoard.org Debian Image 2016-01-24

The kernel in use was 4.4.5-bone5.

For BBG-SWD, "ti-rt" kernel does not work well because PRUSS support
is different in this kernel.

I put the program for PRUSS in: ::

        /usr/local/share/openocd/bbg-swd/pru-swd.bin
